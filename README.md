### Usage

This site should display a start screen. When clicking start it will change to a page with a question on it and a timer in the upper right. As you answer questions new ones will appear. If you get them wrong it adds 5 seconds to the timer. After you complete the quiz or the timer runs out you will be brought to a high score page where you can add your initials to the scoreboard. This is a basic site to test javascript knowlege.
